Users can register, login, and order various menu items.

Using Django's awesome ORM, I designed a relational database to keep track of menu items and user orders. The database allows administrators to update the menu without having to hardcode items in HTML. Additionally, I used JavaScript to ensure a clean and intuitive user experience when placing orders.

To handle user data, I utilized Django's built in authentication system.
